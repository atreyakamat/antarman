# 🌟 Understanding Depression and Coping Strategies

## 🌱 Introduction to Depression

Depression is far more than just feeling sad or going through a rough patch. It's a complex mental health condition that affects millions globally, impacting how we think, feel, and handle daily activities. Understanding depression is the first step toward managing it effectively and finding a path to recovery.
